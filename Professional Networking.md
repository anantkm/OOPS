# Designing a Professional Networking Platform like LinkedIn

In this article, we delve into the object-oriented design and implementation of a professional networking platform like LinkedIn, using Python3. 

The focus is on user profiles, connections, job postings, and feed interactions.

## System Requirements

The platform should facilitate:

1. **User Profile Management:** Creation and management of user profiles.
2. **Connection Management:** Enable users to connect with each other.
3. **Job Posting and Application:** Facilitate posting job listings and applying for them.
4. **Feed and Postings:** Display a feed of posts and activities from connections.

## Core Use Cases

1. **Creating and Updating User Profiles**
2. **Adding and Managing Connections**
3. **Posting and Applying for Jobs**
4. **Viewing and Creating Posts in the Feed**

## Key Classes:
- `LinkedInSystem`: Manages the overall system operations.
- `User`: Represents a user profile.
- `Connection`: Manages user connections.
- `Job`: Represents a job listing.
- `Post`: Represents a post in the user feed.

## Python3 Implementation

### User Class

Manages user profile information and activities.

```python
from typing import List
import time

class User:
    def __init__(self, name: str, email: str):
        self.user_id: str = self.generate_user_id()
        self.name: str = name
        self.email: str = email
        self.connections: List['User'] = []
        self.posts: List['Post'] = []

    def connect(self, user: 'User'):
        self.connections.append(user)

    def post(self, post: 'Post'):
        self.posts.append(post)

    def generate_user_id(self) -> str:
        return f"U-{int(time.time() * 1000)}"

```
### Connection Class
Represents a connection between two users.
```python
class Connection:
    def __init__(self, user1: User, user2: User):
        self.user1: User = user1
        self.user2: User = user2
        self.establish()

    def establish(self):
        self.user1.connect(self.user2)
        self.user2.connect(self.user1)

```
### Job Class
Represents a job listing.
```python
class Job:
    def __init__(self, title: str, description: str):
        self.job_id: str = self.generate_job_id()
        self.title: str = title
        self.description: str = description

    def generate_job_id(self) -> str:
        return f"J-{int(time.time() * 1000)}"

```
### Post Class
Represents a post in the user feed.
```python
class Post:
    def __init__(self, author: User, content: str):
        self.author: User = author
        self.content: str = content
        self.timestamp: float = time.time()

```
### LinkedInSystem Class
Main class managing the networking system.
```python
class LinkedInSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.users: List[User] = []
        self.jobs: List[Job] = []
        self.posts: List[Post] = []

    def add_user(self, user: User):
        self.users.append(user)

    def add_job(self, job: Job):
        self.jobs.append(job)

    def add_post(self, post: Post):
        self.posts.append(post)
```

### Example Usage
```python 
def main():
    # Initialize the LinkedIn-like system
    system = LinkedInSystem()

    # Create users
    alice = User("Alice Johnson", "alice@example.com")
    bob = User("Bob Smith", "bob@example.com")
    system.add_user(alice)
    system.add_user(bob)

    # Establish a connection between users
    connection = Connection(alice, bob)

    # Add a job listing
    job = Job("Software Engineer", "Develop and maintain software applications.")
    system.add_job(job)

    # Users post updates
    post = Post(alice, "Excited to start a new job!")
    system.add_post(post)

    # Display some outputs
    print(f"User: {alice.name}, Email: {alice.email}")
    print(f"Connected to: {[user.name for user in alice.connections]}")
    print(f"Post: {post.content} by {post.author.name}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```
